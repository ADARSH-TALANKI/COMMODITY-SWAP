# COMMODITY-SWAP
A Solidity-based decentralized commodity swap that enables fixed-price agreements settled using oracle prices. The contract enforces margin requirements, provides a time-bound grace period for collateral shortfalls, and maintains an on-chain reputation system to incentivize compliant behavior and penalize defaults.
